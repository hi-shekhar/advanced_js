**Question:** Explain, in detail, the differences between `null` and `undefined` in JavaScript. Provide examples of when you might encounter each.

Think about how you'd approach this, and we can discuss your answer.
This is an excellent starting point, and crucial for a senior role. Let's break down `null` and `undefined`.

### Explanation of `null` vs. `undefined`:

**`undefined`:**

  * **Meaning:** Represents the absence of a value where one is expected but hasn't been provided. It typically indicates something that hasn't been initialized or doesn't exist.
  * **Origin:** JavaScript itself assigns `undefined` in several scenarios:
      * **Declared but uninitialized variables:** `let x; console.log(x); // undefined`
      * **Missing function parameters:** If a function is called with fewer arguments than parameters, the missing parameters will be `undefined`.
        ```javascript
        function greet(name) {
            console.log(name);
        }
        greet(); // undefined
        ```
      * **Non-existent object properties:** Attempting to access a property that doesn't exist on an object.
        ```javascript
        const obj = {};
        console.log(obj.foo); // undefined
        ```
      * **Function without a `return` statement (or `return;`):** Functions implicitly return `undefined` if no `return` value is specified.
        ```javascript
        function doNothing() {}
        console.log(doNothing()); // undefined
        ```
  * **Type:** `typeof undefined` returns `"undefined"`. It's its own primitive type.

**`null`:**

  * **Meaning:** Represents the **intentional absence of any object value**. It's a primitive value that signifies "no value" or "empty." It's a value that a programmer explicitly assigns.
  * **Origin:**
      * **Explicit assignment:** You, the developer, assign `null` to a variable to indicate it currently holds no value.
        ```javascript
        let user = null; // No user is selected yet
        ```
      * **DOM APIs:** Many DOM methods return `null` when an element is not found (e.g., `document.getElementById('nonExistentElement')`).
      * **JSON:** When JSON.parse() encounters `null` in a string, it converts it to the JavaScript `null` value. `null` is preserved during JSON serialization, whereas `undefined` properties are often omitted.
  * **Type:** This is the famous quirk\! `typeof null` returns `"object"`. This is a long-standing bug in JavaScript that was inherited from its early implementation, where `null` was represented internally with the same type tag as objects (`000`). It's impossible to fix now due to web compatibility. Therefore, you **cannot** rely on `typeof` to distinguish `null` from actual objects.

**Key Differences Summarized:**

| Feature       | `undefined`                                      | `null`                                                 |
| :------------ | :----------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Meaning** | Value not yet defined/assigned (uninitialized)   | Intentional absence of any object value (explicitly set) |
| **Origin** | Assigned by JavaScript                           | Assigned by developer or specific APIs                 |
| **`typeof`** | `"undefined"`                                    | `"object"` (historical bug)                            |
| **Equality** | `undefined == null` is `true` (loose equality)   | `null == undefined` is `true` (loose equality)         |
|               | `undefined === null` is `false` (strict equality)| `null === undefined` is `false` (strict equality)      |
| **Falsy** | Both are falsy in a boolean context (`if (!value)`) | Both are falsy                                        |

**Coding Challenge:** Write a function that takes a value and returns `"null"` if the value is `null`, `"undefined"` if the value is `undefined`, and `"other"` otherwise. You should use strict equality checks.
